    <p>The iPhone X (Roman numeral "X" pronounced "ten")[9][10] is a smartphone designed, developed, and marketed by Apple Inc. It is the eleventh generation of the iPhone and was announced on September 12, 2017, alongside the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, at the Steve Jobs Theater in the Apple Park campus. It was available to pre-order on October 27, 2017 and was released on November 3, 2017. </p>

     <p>The iPhone X was intended to showcase what Apple considered the technology of the future. Using a glass and stainless-steel form factor and "bezel-less" design, shrinking the bezels, and not having a "chin", unlike many Android phones. It was the first iPhone to use an OLED screen. The home button's fingerprint sensor was replaced with a new type of authentication called Face ID, which used sensors to scan the user's face to unlock the device. This face-recognition capability also enabled emojis to be animated following the user's expression (Animoji). With a bezel-less design, iPhone user interaction changed significantly, using gestures to navigate the operating system rather than the home button used in all previous iPhones. At the time of its November 2017 launch, its price tag of $999 USD also made it the most expensive iPhone ever, with even higher prices internationally due to additional local sales and import taxes. </p>

    <p id="middleofpage">The technology behind the iPhone X was in development for five years, as far back as 2012.[13] Rumors of a drastic iPhone redesign began circulating around the time of iPhone 7 announcement in the third quarter of 2016,[14][15] and intensified when a HomePod firmware leak in July 2017 suggested that Apple would shortly release a phone with a nearly bezel-less design, lack of a physical home button, facial recognition, and other new features.[16] A near-final development version of the iOS 11 operating system was also leaked in September 2017, confirming the new design and features.[17]</p>

    <p>Animals (also called Metazoa) are multicellular eukaryotic organisms that form the biological kingdom Animalia. With few exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, are able to move, can reproduce sexually, and grow from a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development. Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described—of which around 1 million are insects—but it has been estimated there are over 7 million animal species in total. Animals range in length from 8.5 micrometres (0.00033 in) to 33.6 metres (110 ft). They have complex interactions with each other and their environments, forming intricate food webs. The kingdom Animalia includes humans but in colloquial use the term animal often refers only to non-human animals. The scientific study of animals is known as zoology.</p>
